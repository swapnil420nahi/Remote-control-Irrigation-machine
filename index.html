            <h2>In the Project</h2>
            <p>Objective of the project is to make the remote-control irrigation
                system. But it is easy to install, Arduino based circuit and give joy to remote centrally
                play like video games. It has design like to cover all the area present in garden, by
                projectile thrown the stream of water at 360-degree direction.
                 The design of the devise is such that it can solve many
                problems. It can thus be made to specify the requirements of users. Also, this makes
                portable, low maintenance design for model. And it also use for other purposes.
                </p>
            <p>It involves coding to the Arduino
                board so the circuit can be controlled by its own language. The Arduino connected
                with the IR sensor so that it can be controlled with the help of IR remote. It also
                involves many types of circuit components. If we send our command to the machine
                it detected by IR sensor and it send that command to the Arduino, as per code we
                given to Arduino it sends to the respective part of machine. As this way device works
                properly in the way we give.</p>
